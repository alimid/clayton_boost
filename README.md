# Clayton-boost
Clayton-boost is a gradient boosting algorithm for time-to-event analysis, which allows dependent censored data. Clayton-boost is built upon the accelerated failure time model, and uses a Clayton copula to handle the dependency between the event and censoring distributions. The apporoach takes advantage of the XGBoost framework for performing gradient boosting.
